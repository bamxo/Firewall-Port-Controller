This repository contains a firewall controller program designed to manage network traffic based on port numbers. The firewall controller implements rules and policies to control access and filtering of packets based on specific port numbers.

## Overview

The firewall controller is built to provide granular control over network traffic by utilizing port numbers. It allows administrators to define rules and policies for different ports to enforce security measures and optimize network performance.

## Features

- **Port-based Filtering:** Control access and filtering of packets based on source and destination port numbers.
- **Rule Management:** Define and configure firewall rules for specific port ranges.
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic based on port numbers to identify and mitigate potential security threats.
- **Logging and Reporting:** Log firewall activities and generate reports to analyze network traffic patterns and security events.
- **User Interface:** Command-line interface (CLI) for configuring firewall rules and monitoring network traffic.
